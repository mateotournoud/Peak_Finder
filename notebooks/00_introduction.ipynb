    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook serves as an interactive user manual for the **Python Peak Finder**, a tool that detects peaks in both simulations and measurements in optical emission spectroscopy (OES) data, classifies peaks by magnitude, and assigns each to candidate atomic elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section of this document explains how the algorithm works; what the input variables are; its strengths, weaknesses, and limitations; and where users must make design choices to obtain results suited to their purposes. Every step includes a runnable cell where parameters can be set, results computed, and outputs interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code resides in the `peak_finder` module, written in Python 3.11."

    "### Description of the topic\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Python Peak Finder** detects local maxima in OES spectra using the `scipy.signal.find_peaks()` function (Virtanen et al.). Each local maximum (also called a peak) is assigned to an emission line in the NIST (Kramida et al., ‘NIST LIBS Database.’) and/or Kurucz (Smith et al., ‘Atomic Spectral Line Database from CD-ROM 23 of R. L. Kurucz.’) databases. The tool checks whether lines from the theoretical spectrum correspond to experimental peaks by verifying that their wavelengths align. If several candidate elements can explain a peak, the algorithm provides a ranked list using user-provided plasma parameters, such as temperature and electron density. For each element under analysis, several coefficients are evaluated, and the algorithm decides whether the element is present or not."

    "### Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "TIG (GTAW) welding uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode with inert shielding gas, usually argon, helium, or their blends, to produce high-quality, precise welds in high-integrity applications such as the semiconductor, automotive, and aerospace industries; in applications involving aluminum and stainless steel; in the fabrication of nuclear reactors and submarines; and in many other specific cases (Johnson Kutelu et al.). The benefits of using TIG welding for such specific applications include, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is possible to obtain very precise welds because of the ability to control travel speed and the high precision of the welding arc.\n",
    "- TIG welding produces less smoke and spatter compared to other welding processes, making it a cleaner process and safer for the welder.\n",
    "- TIG welding is capable of welding a wide range of metals and thicknesses.\n",
    "- It can be used for pipe welding.\n",
    "- The welding process can be performed with or without filler material.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, welding quality for such applications is expected to be exceptional. For example, poor weld quality in a nuclear component could have severe consequences. On the other hand, this welding process is also more expensive than other procedures:\n",
    "- *Time costs are higher:* TIG welding is a relatively slow process compared to other procedures.\n",
    "- *Labor costs are higher:* it requires more experience and skill from the welder because of the need to control the electric arc and the electrode manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "These factors make this welding process an excellent candidate for developing a monitoring tool that can prevent rework and failures and elevate overall quality."

    "### State of the art\n",
    "\n",
    "The first version of the Python Peak Finder was developed between March 2023 and February 2024. It detected peaks in measured OES spectra and in reference spectra from NIST or Kurucz, given at fixed temperature and electron density. Matching was essentially based on wavelength agreement. The reference spectrum was later replaced by AtomSpec, developed by Daniel Meier, which can calculate reference peaks at user-defined temperature and electron density from the NIST and Kurucz element databases. Another version of this capability is a script by Matthias Schmidt, written in Mathematica.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between April and May 2025, Daniel Meier also developed a continuum-subtraction function, which allows the user to subtract the continuum spectrum from the measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This specialization project targets robustness by selecting appropriate peak-finding parameters, choosing wavelength tolerances, and resolving line superpositions so that false identifications are reduced."
